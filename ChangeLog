# ChangeLog for sudox:

*sudox-4.1.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Provide sudoxe, see README
	- Use -e now to check for active tmux/screen environment
	- Special mode for empty user to make sudoxe implementation easy
	- Avoid LC_COLLATE hack

*sudox-4.0.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix help

*sudox-4.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- "script" is used to open a new tty, simultaneously avoiding security
	  risks and problems with screen/tmux
	- The hacks with tty permissions (options -y and -Y) are thus unneeded
	- The test for STY/TMUX (and override option -f) is also unneeded now
	- The new option -l (currently identical to -e) unsets STY/TMUX
	- The new option -T prevents using "script", and combined with -x
	  substitutes the previous option -X which has thus been dropped.
	  A warning has been added to this option, because using this option
	  without changing tty permission or STY/TMUX checks is dangerous
	  if the tty is used in the session. However, it is better to leave
	  this responsibility to the user than to do unreliable hacks/checks.
	- By default, if SUDO_ASKPASS is set, -A is passed to sudo
	- The new option -p avoids the new magic -A passing
	- A duplicate removal of a temp dir has been fixed (security fix)
	- "CMD <file" might start CMD in a subshell (e.g. in Bourne shells).
	  The code works now whether this is the case or not
	- The option -V now prints the version of sudox, not of sudo
