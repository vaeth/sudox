# ChangeLog for sudox:

*sudox-9.0.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Make sudoxe a program for usage with eval
	- Require >=push-v2.0 to provide a more descriptive error message

*sudox-8.3.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix -T (regression introduced in sudox-5.0.0)
	- Recommend to combine -F0 with -T

*sudox-8.3.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- New option -O to restore/keep original HOME
	- New/changed option: Let -F0 close stdin. Use -F0,0 for cat piping

*sudox-8.2.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- New -F0 special case using cat
	- New option -X to support sudo -F0 user true >/dev/null && sudo -X ...

*sudox-8.1.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- New code requires only one auxiliary file descriptor for -F.
	  Thanks again to Helmut Waitzmann <nn.throttle at xoxy.net> in
	  usenet post <87wphxajjz.fsf@helmutwaitzmann.news.arcor.de>

*sudox-8.0.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Use sh
	- Fix test whether variable was passed

*sudox-8.0.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Option -vDISPLAY is the new default, because also sudo has the
	  default to preserve the variable DISPLAY
	- Option -F now takes precedence over -v (because of the new default)
	- Option -F- to select FIFO method (which was default previously)
	- Option -v- to select new "command line" method
	- Due to the new secure default setting, the security notes are no
	  longer emphasized
	- sudoers.d has been modified to the new default variable. It now
	  contains no uncommented line, because sudox passes DISPLAY by default
	- env.d has been removed: It is no longer recommended to set SUDOX_OPT.
	  Maybe in a future release, SUDOX_OPT will be removed completely
	- Option -o now actually works ;)
	- zsh completion: Fix defaults for -F, -C, -v
	- zsh completion: Specify "file descriptor"
	- internal: Avoid magic string separation hack: we must use eval anyway
	- internal: Simplify remote call syntax, in particular for displays

*sudox-7.0.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Recommendations and remarks have been moved from the help page to
	  the README file
	- Support also -vXAUTHORITY and all other variables (except sx_*)
	- New option -F#[,#a[,#b]] which allows passing cookies through
	  file descriptor #.
	  Thanks a lot to Helmut Waitzmann <nn.throttle at xoxy.net>
	  for describing the necessery file-dup magic in detail in usenet post
	  <8737kpggy4.fsf@helmutwaitzmann.news.arcor.de>
	- New option -o to collect arbitrary option to sudo; also be verbose in
	  help which options are passed and whether they take argument
	- Unset XAUTHORITY when cookies are passed
	- More care in freeing memory
	- Fix duplicate calculation of script path

*sudox-6.0.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- New option -vVAR which allows passing cookies by variable VAR
	  instead through a fifo. This is a big security enhancement
	  (and the sudox process can terminate earlier).
	  Use this if you can configure sudo to pass VAR.
	  Good choices for VAR are DISPLAY or SUDOX_OPT.
	  To make using this option easier, there is the new
	- SUDOX_OPT: This variable can contain default options.
	- Rename options for root/non-root mode into -R/-N,
	  because -r is already used by sudo
	- Some options had not been accepted due to a typo
	- Fix zsh completion: Add missing options and dependencies

*sudox-5.0.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Transfer DISPLAY even if restricted by sudo
	- Support XAUTHORITY for transfer to root (or depending on -r -R):
	  This makes it unnecessary to pass data through fifo
	  (more secure, and the sudox process can terminate ealier)
	- Emit -- for sudo/screen calls only if necessary
	- Act more reliable when destination user is current user
	- Honour XAUTHORITY of calling side
	- Free memory before forking

*sudox-4.1.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Provide sudoxe, see README
	- Use -e now to check for active tmux/screen environment
	- Special mode for empty user to make sudoxe implementation easy
	- Avoid LC_COLLATE hack

*sudox-4.0.1:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Fix help

*sudox-4.0:
	Martin Väth <martin at mvath.de>:
	- "script" is used to open a new tty, simultaneously avoiding security
	  risks and problems with screen/tmux
	- The hacks with tty permissions (options -y and -Y) are thus unneeded
	- The test for STY/TMUX (and override option -f) is also unneeded now
	- The new option -l (currently identical to -e) unsets STY/TMUX
	- The new option -T prevents using "script", and combined with -x
	  substitutes the previous option -X which has thus been dropped.
	  A warning has been added to this option, because using this option
	  without changing tty permission or STY/TMUX checks is dangerous
	  if the tty is used in the session. However, it is better to leave
	  this responsibility to the user than to do unreliable hacks/checks.
	- By default, if SUDO_ASKPASS is set, -A is passed to sudo
	- The new option -p avoids the new magic -A passing
	- A duplicate removal of a temp dir has been fixed (security fix)
	- "CMD <file" might start CMD in a subshell (e.g. in Bourne shells).
	  The code works now whether this is the case or not
	- The option -V now prints the version of sudox, not of sudo
