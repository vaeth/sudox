sudox is a POSIX shell script which acts as a wrapper for
sudo -Hs with passing X authority data to the client.

It is possible to create temporary untrusted X permissions.
Also some support for tty handling (e.g. screen and tmux) is provided.

For more details, see the output of sudox -h

If you want to change the user for the remainder of the whole shell session
and are somewhat paranoic to do this by accident from a runnnig
screen or tmux session, you can use "sudoxe" in place of sudox:
This is essentially "exec sudox", but checks your environment first.
Be aware that when using sudoxe (or "exec sudox") and sudo asks for a
password, a wrong password will terminate your session anyway.
(Please let me know if you know a trick how to avoid this problem...)

For installation, copy sudox bin/* to your $PATH and add the line

. sudoxe

to your shell startup file to define the shell functions sudox() and sudoxe()
(sudox() calls sudox with a secure PATH setting). Alternatively, add these
functions or modifications thereof directly to your shell startup file.

To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy zsh/* to a directory
of zsh's $fpath

You will need push.sh from https://github.com/vaeth/push in your path.

It is strongly recommended to copy sudoers.d/* to /etc/sudoers.d and to set
appropriate permissions. If you do this, it is also strongly recommended to
export the variables from env.d/* to your user's shell startup files.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
